      <description>Converting to Orthodoxy will be the result of a lot of openmindedness. I had read most, if not all, of the primary arguments for Orthodoxy before. They are dismissed easily enough by the Catholic worldview; the Pope is, after all, an infallible authority with Apostolic ties, and the Catholic Church claims to be the sole holder of the fullness of truth. Openness of heart and mind is needed to come to an honest assessment of the claims of each church, in the West especially so because of the relative paucity of material presenting the Orthodox side of things as compared to Catholic Apologetic material.</description>
